        ### Our Mission
        
        The Mental Wellness Tracker was created with a simple mission: to help people understand 
        and improve their mental wellbeing in the digital age.
        
        In a world where we spend increasing amounts of time on social media and digital platforms, 
        it's important to be aware of how these interactions affect our mental health. Our tool helps you:
        
        - **Track your mood** and mental state over time
        - **Identify patterns** between platform usage and emotional wellbeing
        - **Receive personalized suggestions** for improving digital wellness
        - **Visualize progress** on your mental health journey
        
        We believe that awareness is the first step toward positive change. By regularly checking in 
        with yourself and tracking your mental wellness, you can make informed decisions about your 
        digital habits and take control of your online experiences.

        to your digital habits, you might benefit from checking in more frequently.

        - Your current mood and stress levels
